# MNIST Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project contains a PyTorch implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The CNN architecture is optimized to achieve high accuracy while maintaining a low number of parameters and is capable of running efficiently on GPU.

# Features

- CNN with Batch Normalization and Dropout for improved generalization.
- Utilizes Global Average Pooling (GAP) to reduce the number of parameters.
- Configured with Adam optimizer and a learning rate scheduler for effective training.
- Detailed logging of training and validation metrics for monitoring performance.
